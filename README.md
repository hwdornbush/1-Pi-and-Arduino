# Pi-and-Arduino
A comparison of Raspberry Pi and Arduino
This session explores the differences between the 
•	Microcomputer, or Single Board Computer (SBC) such as Raspberry Pi, and
•	Microcontroller such as Arduino
We will then explore a simple Arduino project, Blinking an LED and Wi-Fi Scanning.  I will demonstrate an Arduino based NTP clock which I find useful in my shack.
